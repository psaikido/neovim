replay with @a

vim -c 'bufdo exe "norm gg=G" | w' -c 'q' *.php
17:27 < \amethyst> psaikido:  bufdo runs a command on all buffers; exe runs a
                  string as a command (it's just a hack to get around the
                  multiple meanings of |)
17:27 < \amethyst> psaikido:  norm  runs a series of normal-mode keypresses
17:28 < \amethyst> psaikido:  and you know what w and q do
17:28 < \amethyst> psaikido:  :help :bufdo    :help :norm  :help exe  :help -c 

zt
move current line to the top of the window

folding:
highlight a block with shift+v and movements
then zf to create fold
zo opens and zc closes

fold all functions in a file:
g:function:exe "norm v$%zf"

with lots of windows open within a session you can save it with
:mks [name].vims
and then use that file to open the whole lot next time ie:
vim -S [name].vims

multiple file search and replace for multiple things:
eg:make a file with the commands that you want in like this..
  %s: BankDepositDates: tx_wcfmem_BankDepositDates:gec | update
  %s: Bursaries: tx_wcfmem_Bursaries:gec | update
  %s: Contacts: tx_wcfmem_Contacts:gec | update

..then open vim and go..
  :args *.php (this puts all the relevant files into memory buffers)
  :argdo :so [scriptName.s]

Output results of a command into a new buffer
enew | put=execute('set runtimepath?')
